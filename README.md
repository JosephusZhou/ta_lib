# Ta_lib

*A dart version of [TA-Lib](https://ta-lib.org/).*

**Important:** If you want to use the source code by yourself rather than download the latest release or install by pub directly, please consider to use the source code from [the main branch](https://github.com/JosephusZhou/ta_lib/tree/main), the develop branch is under development and I cannot guarantee it to be stable.
